All navigation files contained in the repository are free for personal use. 
Any use outside of personal use is free to use as long as it is credited. 
Credit as much as you'd like but bare minimum mention Quake Nav Depot 
(ex: 'Bot navigation from Quake Nav Depot'). This extends to any derivative navigations.

Any work that is uploaded / merged into the repository automatically becomes as 
belonging to the depot and gives a license to the depot for the uploaded work 
to be used as however it wants under the license.

The original creator of the navigation file still owns the 'copyright' and is free to
do whatever they want with it, but by uploading to the depot that version of the 
navigation file is now under the depot license. This means if you wish to develop 
your navigation file further for any purpose outside of the depot, you can do without 
limitations, as long you don't use any contributions from the depot.
