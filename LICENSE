Any use outside of 'personal use' is allowed, as long as it is credited. 
Credit as much as you'd like but bare minimum mention that the navs originated from 'Quake Nav Depot'.
(ex: 'Bot navigation from Quake Nav Depot'). This extends to any derivative navigations.

Any work that is uploaded / merged / commited into the repository by the original author is
automatically bound by this license. Other people can contribute changes and modifications
for all the navs in the repository (under the repository maintainer discretion).
