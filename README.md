# Quake Nav Depot

This is a repository for Quake 2021 Enhanced bot navigation files where the community can download, edit and contribute.

## How to download

If you want to download a navigation file for a map, you're going to need [nav2json](https://github.com/jpiolho/nav2json). This tool allows you to convert from .navjson to .nav.

1. Drag and drop the .navjson file into nav2json.exe. This will convert the .navjson to .nav
2. Place the resulting .nav file into the bot navigation folder (eg: id1/bots/navigation)
3. Done!

## How to contribute

Regardless if you're improving an existing navigation or adding a whole new map, you're welcome to! Just make sure to read and understand the **license** first.

Make a Pull Request with your changes in order to able to contribute. If you're not sure what that is, we recommend to read up on Github Pull Requests (at some point we'll have better documentation here about it).

Remember to add yourself to the "Contributors" field in the .navjson. If you're uploading a new map, make sure to fill out the map information fields as well.

## License

@JPiolho: I'm not lawyer so I hope the license is enough, but the main purpose of this license is to give some clarity to 'copyrights' and similar stuff.
As we've seen with Quake Enhanced there are some copyright hell regarding some community mods which make it hard to impossible to track down all the authors of some mod to be able to include it 'officially' for example.

TLDR:
* Free to use the navigation files for any purpose as long as, bare minimum, credited that it came from 'Quake Nav Depot'.
* Any work contributed or uploaded to the depot becomes covered by the license
